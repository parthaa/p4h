For this lesson, please do the following:
* Use the `cron` type
* Use the `file` type to create a folder with another file inside
* Use the `host` type to create an /etc/hosts entry
* Use the `mount` type (a bind mount is okay)

Bonus:
* Use the `augeas` type		# to be used in emergencies or special cases!
** Name one use for the `augeas` type...

Level 42:

Happy hacking!\n",
